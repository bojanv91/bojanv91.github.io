Global Day of Coderetreat 2016 in Skopje, Macedonia

``#GDCR16`` is a day for celebrating passion and software craftsmanship. This year's event in Skopje, Macedonia was a blast! Many fresh ideas, new perspectives and great people - everything that you need for such an event.

## About the event

[Coderetreat](http://globalday.coderetreat.org/) is a one day event that provides developers the opportunity for skills improvement by focusing on software development and **design fundamentals**. By practicing the basic principles of **modular and object-oriented design**, participants can improve their ability to write code that **minimizes the cost of change over time**. It aims to shrink the gap between the code we write under pressure of needing to deliver on time and the perfect code.

## Hosting and facilitating

This year's Coderetreat in Macedonia was hosted, organized and sponsored by [HASELT](http://www.haselt.com/) and facilitated by [Dalibor Nasevic](dalibornasevic.com) (a long time facilitator of Coderetreat events in Macedonia). 

Here are some photos from the atmosphere:

## Sessions

Starting early in the morning, the participants were introduced with the agenda and the rules of the event by the facilitator Dalibor Nasevic. They had 5 sessions in pair programming, and after each session, time for retrospectives and short breaks.

The first session was intended to get the participants familiar with the problem, and introduction to [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life). In the second session, "Ping-pong pair programming", the pairs learned the importance of communication when pairing and collaborate together to see other ways of writing code. The third session was "No primitives across method boundaries (input or output)". In the fourth session, "No conditionals", the pairs had to find ways of avoiding conditionals and fewer logical paths. The last session, "Evil pair programming" was designed to practice writing quality tests, where the tester tries to write good tests and the coder writes just enough code to pass tests.

At the end of the sessions, the participants had the final retrospective with the facilitator and shared their thoughts about what did they learn, what surprised them the most and what they would do differently.

## Impressions from the event

Being able to see so diverse thoughts about designing software was truly inspirational, and the way how people collaborated and shared their ideas was really empowering to everyone, including myself. 

Personally, if I have to choose only a single event that I would like to attend to, Coderetreat would be definitely *that* one. 

**Here are impressions shared by my awesome colleagues, the driving force of the whole organization:**

>We had an amazing time, meeting developers willing to learn, improve and also share their knowledge with others. We hope that the participants found this event as inspirational and productive as we do.

**and also, the impressions shared by Dalibor who put his energy and enthusiasm guiding the participants during the whole day:**

>It was great experience for me being part of another Global Day of Coderetreat and facilitate the local event in Skopje. I am very grateful to Bojan and the rest of the HASELT team for their passion and inspirational energy in organizing and hosting the event. I'm very happy for the attendees too. The ones for who the event is. The ones that chose to spend that Saturday practicing software design with other developers, work in different programming languages, share their knowledge and improve their craft together. Their passion, their positive energy and their enthusiasm. It's great to see how inspirational the event can be for them and what they are going to change on their daily jobs starting Monday.

## What's next?

Next, after being part of this very inspirational event, we are encouraged to contribute even more to the local software development community. So, we put ourselves a goal to organize many similar tech events, workshops and regular meet-ups in order to bring the local community even closer, by encouraging discussions, empowering people, sharing experiences and ideas. Stay tuned for more info which is coming, very soon!
