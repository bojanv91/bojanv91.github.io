This year's event in Skopje, Macedonia was a blast! Fresh ideas, new perspectives and great people is everything you need for such an event.&lt;!--excerpt--&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;About the event&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://globalday.coderetreat.org/"&gt;Coderetreat&lt;/a&gt; is a one day event that provides developers the opportunity for skills improvement by focusing on software development and &lt;strong&gt;design fundamentals&lt;/strong&gt;. By practicing the basic principles of &lt;strong&gt;modular and object-oriented design&lt;/strong&gt;, participants can improve their ability to write code that &lt;strong&gt;minimizes the cost of change over time&lt;/strong&gt;. It aims to shrink the gap between the code we write under pressure of needing to deliver on time and the perfect code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Hosting and facilitating&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.haselt.com/"&gt;HASELT&lt;/a&gt; hosted, organized and sponsored this year's Coderetreat in Macedonia. &lt;a href="http://bojanv91.github.io/dalibornasevic.com"&gt;Dalibor Nasevic&lt;/a&gt;, who is a long time facilitator of Coderetreat events, facilitated this year's event too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Sessions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting early in the morning the facilitator introduced the agenda for the day. There were five sessions of pair programming. After each session, retrospective meetings were held where each pair discussed what they did. After that, participants switched pairs and prepared for the next session.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first session was intended to get the participants familiar with the problem, and introduction to &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life"&gt;Conway's Game of Life&lt;/a&gt;. In the second session, "Ping-pong pair programming", the pairs learned the importance of communication when pairing and collaborate together to see other ways of writing code. The third session was "No primitives across method boundaries (input or output)". In the fourth session, "No conditionals", the pairs had to find ways of avoiding conditionals and fewer logical paths. The last session, "Evil pair programming" was designed to practice writing quality tests, where the tester tries to write good tests and the coder writes just enough code to pass tests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of all sessions, the participants had the final retrospective with Dalibor. He asked the following questions, to which all participants shared their thoughts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What, if anything, did you learn today?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What, if anything, surprised you today?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What, if anything, will you do differently moving forward?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://bojanv91.github.io/images/2016-10-27-global-day-of-coderetreat-2016-haselt-macedonia/4.png" alt="Global Day of Coderetreat 2016 in Skopje, Macedonia" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Impressions from the event&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being able to see so diverse thoughts about designing software was truly inspirational, and the way how people collaborated and shared their ideas was really empowering to everyone, including myself. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally, if I have to choose only a single event that I would like to attend to, Coderetreat would be definitely &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; one. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here are impressions shared by my awesome colleagues, the driving force of the whole organization:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We had an amazing time, meeting developers willing to learn, improve and also share their knowledge with others. We hope that the participants found this event as inspirational and productive as we do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;and also, the impressions shared by Dalibor who put his energy and enthusiasm guiding the participants during the whole day:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It was great experience for me being part of another Global Day of Coderetreat and facilitate the local event in Skopje. I am very grateful to Bojan and the rest of the HASELT team for their passion and inspirational energy in organizing and hosting the event. I'm very happy for the attendees too. The ones for who the event is. The ones that chose to spend that Saturday practicing software design with other developers, work in different programming languages, share their knowledge and improve their craft together. Their passion, their positive energy and their enthusiasm. It's great to see how inspirational the event can be for them and what they are going to change on their daily jobs starting Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What's next?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, after being part of this very inspirational event, we are encouraged to contribute even more to the local software development community. So, we put ourselves a goal to organize many similar tech events, workshops and regular meet-ups in order to bring the local community even closer, by encouraging discussions, empowering people, sharing experiences and ideas. Stay tuned for more info which is coming, very soon!&lt;/p&gt;

The &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns"&gt;Separation of Concerns&lt;/a&gt; is applied in both approaches, but not both of them give the same desired clarity and ease for developers. This blogpost focuses on organizing MVC projects around &lt;strong&gt;feature folders&lt;/strong&gt;, which represent the business concerns.&lt;!--excerpt--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the time developers make modifications related to a single feature (e.g. adding new fields, changing business rules, adding validation...). Structuring folders around interrelated files can make modification process simpler. The common MVC folder structure violates the rule of &lt;em&gt;"Files that change together should be structured together"&lt;/em&gt;. Structuring by business concerns embraces this very important rule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Files that change together should be structured together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Horizontal (Technical) vs. Vertical (Business) Folder Structure&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the left side you can see the common MVC structure. On the right side you can see the feature folders structure of the very same project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you see this in your IDE (e.g. in Visual Studio), the distinction between the files is even greater, given that there is accompanied file type icon shown besides the filename.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, imagine you scale in amount of features, in addition to the standard N-Layer stuff like repositories, services, handlers, DTOs, etc... You will soon notice that things are starting to get messy in the technical folders organization. In the feature folders organization, each feature can scale on it's own, thus much easier to manage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Food for thought:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What if we put our CSS and JavaScript files also in these feature folders?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What if one feature folder becomes so demanding on the UI that needs to be a full SPA view/module - can we structure it to use Angular?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can we develop one feature UI in Angular, another one in React, all other in classic server-side MVC, and stay sane with our overall project structure?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example of single feature evolved as Angular application/module:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Features
    ...
    ShoppingCart
        Components
            CartComponent.js
            CartComponent.css
            PaymentComponent.js
            PaymentComponent.css
            CartContainer.js
        App.js
        App.css
        Index.cshtml
        ShoppingCartController.cs
    ...
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Benefits of using Feature Folders (over technical folder structure)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Structuring your files by features (business concerns) makes things easier to find and manage. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Time spent on navigation through Solution Explorer to locate interdependent files is drastically reduced since they are all in a single folder.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You don't step over each other toes with your peers, thus, avoid spending time on fixing merge conflicts. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can scale and modify each feature on its own, independently from other features and even use different UI technology.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You immediately understand what an application does and where to find necessary files for your given requirement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can easily reuse similar features across projects by simply copying just a single folder. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can reason much easier about each feature just by looking in a single (feature) folder.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Implementing Feature Folders in ASP.NET MVC 5&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make this work in ASP.NET MVC 5, we should inherit the &lt;code&gt;RazorViewEngine&lt;/code&gt; and change the view location parts to ones that fit our new structure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public class FeatureFoldersRazorViewEngine : RazorViewEngine
{
    public FeatureFoldersRazorViewEngine()
    {
        var featureFolderViewLocationFormats = new[]
        {
            "~/Features/{1}/{0}.cshtml",
            "~/Features/{1}/{0}.vbhtml",
            "~/Features/Shared/{0}.cshtml",
            "~/Features/Shared/{0}.vbhtml",
        };

        ViewLocationFormats = featureFolderViewLocationFormats;
        MasterLocationFormats = featureFolderViewLocationFormats;
        PartialViewLocationFormats = featureFolderViewLocationFormats;
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, we have to add our newly created &lt;code&gt;FeatureFoldersRazorViewEngine&lt;/code&gt; in our application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public class Global : HttpApplication
{
    void Application_Start(object sender, EventArgs e)
    {
        // ...
        ViewEngines.Engines.Clear();
        ViewEngines.Engines.Add(new FeatureFoldersRazorViewEngine());
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Structuring our MVC projects following feature folders approach increases the productivity of our dev teams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At our company, we have been using feature folders project structure on over dozens projects for over a year, and due to the high success and productivity boost, it became our default project structure on the presentation layer. &lt;/p&gt;

In this article, I demonstrate the re-factoring steps in detail that we've taken and eventually how we employed the &lt;code&gt;Specification Pattern&lt;/code&gt; &lt;!--excerpt--&gt;. Have in mind that, I choose a very basic example in order to keep things simple and avoid confusion that can be arouse from domain complexity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the original code:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;//..

var newCompany = new Company(message.Name, message.CountryId);

// Query all companies from database 
var companies = _companyRepository.Query().ToList();
// Check if the newly created company is unique
if (companies.Any(x =&amp;gt; x.Name == newCompany.Name &amp;amp;&amp;amp; x.CountryId == newCompany.CountryId))
    throw new Exception("A company with the same name and country already exists");

session.Save(newCompany);
//..
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, we can see a few problems. First, all companies are queried from the database, and that can create performance issues. Another problem is too much operations happening in the &lt;code&gt;If&lt;/code&gt; check line; thus, the lengthy line is making the code harder to read. And, the final problem is very plain practice of &lt;code&gt;Exception&lt;/code&gt; throwing. Although, I like expressing explicit guard checks, that code can be better. Let's tackle these problems, one by one, in a few steps along this article and provide some improvement suggestions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, I provide here the &lt;code&gt;tl;dr;&lt;/code&gt; version of the code:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;//..

var newCompany = new Company(message.Name, message.CountryId);

var spec = new UniqueCompanySpecification(_companyRepository);
if (spec.IsSatisfiedBy(newCompany) == false)
    throw new CompanyAlreadyExistsException();

session.Save(newCompany);
//..
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;How we get there?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Step 1 - Solve The Query Performance Issues&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;var numberOfSameCompanies = _companyRepository.Query()
    .Where(x =&amp;gt; x.Name == newCompany.Name &amp;amp;&amp;amp; x.CountryId == newCompany.CountryId)
    .Count();
if (numberOfSameCompanies &amp;gt; 0)
    throw new Exception("A company with the same name and country already exists");
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The query above retrieves the number of companies satisfying the given &lt;code&gt;where&lt;/code&gt; condition. Performance issues have been solved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Step 2 - Make The &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; Condition Check Explicit&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;var numberOfSameCompanies = _companyRepository.Query()
    .Where(x =&amp;gt; x.Name == newCompany.Name &amp;amp;&amp;amp; x.CountryId == newCompany.CountryId)
    .Count();
var doesCompanyAlreadyExists = numberOfSameCompanies &amp;gt; 0;
if (doesCompanyAlreadyExists)
    throw new Exception("A company with the same name and country already exists");
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By setting some explicit conditions, we gain clear understanding of what the code does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Step 3 - Make The Business Rule Violation Explicit&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Original:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;throw new Exception("A company with the same name and country already exists");
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Re-factored to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;throw new CompanyAlreadyExistsException();
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the implementation of the exception:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public class CompanyAlreadyExistsException : Exception
{
    CompanyAlreadyExistsException () 
      :base("A company with the same name and country already exists")
    { 
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, it looks better. Anyway, we have still room for improvements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Step 4 - Encapsulate The Business Rule Check By Employing 'The Specification Pattern'&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 'Specification Pattern' is a tactical design pattern presented in Eric Evans’ book Domain Driven Design. The &lt;code&gt;Specification Pattern&lt;/code&gt; is a way of encapsulating business rule(s) and testing it against a candidate object to see if that object satisfies all requirements expressed in a specification. This pattern fits very good with the Single-Responsibility-Principle (SRP), which states that one class should have only one reason to change. Furthermore, this specification object can be easily unit tested and reused.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, you can see how it is used:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;var spec = new UniqueCompanySpecification(_companyRepository);
if (spec.IsSatisfiedBy(newCompany) == false)
    throw new CompanyAlreadyExistsException();
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the implementation details:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public class UniqueCompanySpecification : ISpecification&amp;lt;Company&amp;gt;
{
    readonly ICompanyRepository _companyRepository;

    public UniqueCompanySpecification(ICompanyRepository companyRepository)
    {
        _companyRepository = companyRepository;
    }

    public bool IsSatisfiedBy(Company candidate)
    {
        var numberOfSameCompanies = _companyRepository.Query()
            .Where(x =&amp;gt; x.Name == newCompany.Name &amp;amp;&amp;amp; x.CountryId == newCompany.CountryId)
            .Count();
        bool isUnique = numberOfSameCompanies == 0;
        return isUnique;
    }
}

public interface ISpecification&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;
{
    bool IsSatisfiedBy(T candidate);
} 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After all re-factoring steps, the final code is as following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;//..

var newCompany = new Company(message.Name, message.CountryId);

var spec = new UniqueCompanySpecification(_companyRepository);
if (spec.IsSatisfiedBy(newCompany) == false)
    throw new CompanyAlreadyExistsException();

session.Save(newCompany);
//..
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Summary&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article, I've shown a re-factoring process and usage of the Specification Pattern in order to satisfy an explicit business rule.&lt;br /&gt;
The re-factoring steps we took:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Solve the query performance issues&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make the &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; condition check explicit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make the business rule violation explicit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Encapsulate the business rule check by employing the Specification Pattern&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Specification Pattern lets you decouple the design of requirements, fulfillment, and validation. It also allows you to make your system definitions more clear and declarative, but be careful not to fall into temptation to over-use it.&lt;/p&gt;

For example, if you install twitter-bootstrap it would automatically install jquery for you, because bootstrap is dependent on jquery. Additionally it gives you version control out of the box for your packages, thus easier installing of updates. So, here is step-by-step guide into installing Bower and prerequisites on Windows. &lt;!--excerpt--&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bower installs all packages under a single folder called bower_components, and holds dependency information in a bower.json file (among other project information).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://bojanv91.github.io/images/2015-03-22-beginners-installation-guide-to-bower-on-windows/Screenshot_1.png" alt="bower initial folder structure" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bower depends on NPM and GIT, so you have to install them first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Recommendation: Working with Bower is done via command line tool. So, I recommend installing more advanced command line utility in order to get happier with some neat features, as &lt;a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/Console2ABetterWindowsCommandPrompt.aspx"&gt;Scott Hanselman blogged about Console2&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Installing Bower and it's prerequisites&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open CMD&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Install Chocolatey&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;@powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy unrestricted -Command "(iex ((new-object net.webclient).DownloadString('https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))) &amp;gt;$null 2&amp;gt;&amp;amp;1" &amp;amp;&amp;amp; SET PATH=%PATH%;%ALLUSERSPROFILE%\chocolatey\bin
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Install GIT (or &lt;a href="http://git-scm.com/downloads"&gt;http://git-scm.com/downloads&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;choco install git.install 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;wait until installation is finished  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;setx path "%path%;C:\Program Files (x86)\Git\bin\"
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Install NodeJS (or &lt;a href="https://nodejs.org/download/"&gt;https://nodejs.org/download/&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;choco install nodejs.install
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;wait until installation is finished&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;setx path "%path%;C:\Program Files\nodejs\"
setx path "%path%;C:\Users\%username%\AppData\Roaming\npm"
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;npm install -g bower&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Profit!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If everything went fine you should be able to user "bower" command in CMD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FAQ&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is Chocolatey?&lt;br /&gt;
Chocolatey is a Machine Package Manager, somewhat like apt-get, but built with Windows in mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is NodeJS?&lt;br /&gt;
Node.js is a platform built on Chrome's JavaScript runtime for easily building fast, scalable network applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is NPM (Node Package Manager)?&lt;br /&gt;
NPM is a package manager for JavaScript, and is the default for Node.js&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is NuGet?&lt;br /&gt;
NuGet is package manager for Microsoft development platform including .NET&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is PATH?&lt;br /&gt;
PATH is an environment variable on Unix-like operating systems, DOS, OS/2, and Microsoft Windows, specifying a set of directories where executable programs are located. In our case, we added the locations of GIT and NPM executables in PATH env variable in order to be able to use them directly in CMD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;From where bower downloads packages?&lt;br /&gt;
bower install jquery (from registered packages in bower repository)&lt;br /&gt;
bower install git://github.com/user/package.git (from GitHub)&lt;br /&gt;
bower install user/package (from GitHub - with shorthand syntax)  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is the simplest way in order to make my custom package publicly available via Bower?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Include bower.json manifest in the root folder&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Push it to GitHub repository&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Profit!  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/ayende/rhino-security"&gt;Rhino Security&lt;/a&gt; is a security framework to provide row level security for NHibernate. Rhino Security is perfect for people who want to set up user and group security in their NHibernate domain models. &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/ayende/rhino-security"&gt;Rhino Security GitHub repository&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More details about the architecture and how Rhino Security works behind the scenes can be found &lt;a href="http://ayende.com/blog/2958/a-vision-of-enterprise-platform-security-infrastructure"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://ayende.com/blog/3109/rhino-security-overview-part-i"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://ayende.com/blog/3113/rhino-security-part-ii-discussing-the-implementation"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Action Plan&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Installing NuGet packages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Configuring StructureMap container and registering Rhino.Security into NHibernate &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Implementing CommonServiceLocator provider for StructureMap&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;User entity that implements Rhino.Security.IUser interface&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Preparing the database schema&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Usage DEMO (code samples &lt;a href="https://github.com/bojanv91/RhinoSecurityWithStructureMap"&gt;https://github.com/bojanv91/RhinoSecurityWithStructureMap&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://bojanv91.github.io/images/2015-01-11-getting-started-with-rhino-security-structuremap/rhino-01.png" alt="Getting started with Rhino Security and StructureMap" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Installing NuGet packages&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Install-Package Rhino.Security          
Install-Package NHibernate
Install-Package FluentNHibernate
Install-Package StructureMap
Install-Package CommonServiceLocator
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FluentNHibernate provides fluent mapping interface for mapping our domain model entities to table structures via NHibernate.&lt;br /&gt;
CommonServiceLocator provides abstraction over IoC containers and service locators and contains a shared interface for service location. Rhino Security makes use of it, that is why can be used with any IoC container. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Configuring StructureMap container and registering Rhino.Security into NHibernate&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the following code snippet I have all configuration stuff in one class, called the Bootstrapper. It's purpose is to provide functionality for booting up our application, the starting point. Explanations about what does what are put in comments. If something is still unclear do write me a comment, I'll happily update that part. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;using FluentNHibernate.Cfg;
using FluentNHibernate.Cfg.Db;
using NHibernate;
using NHibernate.Cfg;
using NHibernate.Context;
using Rhino.Security.Interfaces;
using Rhino.Security.Services;

namespace RhinoSecurityWithStructureMap
{
    public class Bootstrapper
    {
        public static void Bootstrap(string connectionString)
        {
            var container = new StructureMap.Container();
            container.Configure(cfg =&amp;gt;
                {
                    //NHibernate configurations 
                    cfg.For&amp;lt;ISessionFactory&amp;gt;().Singleton().Use(() =&amp;gt; CreateSessionFactory(connectionString));
                    cfg.For&amp;lt;ISession&amp;gt;().Use(context =&amp;gt; GetSession(context));

                    //Rhino Security configurations 
                    cfg.For&amp;lt;IAuthorizationService&amp;gt;().Use&amp;lt;AuthorizationService&amp;gt;();
                    cfg.For&amp;lt;IAuthorizationRepository&amp;gt;().Use&amp;lt;AuthorizationRepository&amp;gt;();
                    cfg.For&amp;lt;IPermissionsBuilderService&amp;gt;().Use&amp;lt;PermissionsBuilderService&amp;gt;();
                    cfg.For&amp;lt;IPermissionsService&amp;gt;().Use&amp;lt;PermissionsService&amp;gt;();
                });

            //Setting up StuctureMapServiceLocator as a CommonServiceLocator that Rhino.Security will use for DI
            Microsoft.Practices.ServiceLocation.ServiceLocator
                .SetLocatorProvider(() =&amp;gt; new StructureMapServiceLocator(container));
        }

        private static ISessionFactory CreateSessionFactory(string connectionString)
        {
            FluentConfiguration fluentConfig = Fluently.Configure()
                .Database(MsSqlConfiguration.MsSql2012.ConnectionString(connectionString))          //specifying connection string for Microsoft SQL Server 2012 
                .Mappings(m =&amp;gt; m.FluentMappings.AddFromAssemblyOf&amp;lt;Bootstrapper&amp;gt;())                  //specifying in which assembly NHibernate should look for entity mappings
                .CurrentSessionContext(typeof(ThreadStaticSessionContext).AssemblyQualifiedName)    //specifying the session context lifecycle to be initialized per thread
                .ExposeConfiguration(cfg =&amp;gt;
                {
                    Rhino.Security.Security.Configure&amp;lt;User&amp;gt;(cfg, Rhino.Security.SecurityTableStructure.Prefix);
                });

            return fluentConfig.BuildSessionFactory();
        }

        private static ISession GetSession(StructureMap.IContext context)
        {
            var sessionFactory = context.GetInstance&amp;lt;ISessionFactory&amp;gt;();
            return sessionFactory.GetCurrentSession();
        }
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Implementing CommonServiceLocator provider for StructureMap&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The code is pretty much straightforward. We just implement Microsoft.Practices.ServiceLocation.IServiceLocator interface with the common code that is provided to us by StructureMap IContainer interface, basically this class acts as a wrapper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public class StructureMapServiceLocator : Microsoft.Practices.ServiceLocation.IServiceLocator
{
    private readonly IContainer _container;

    public StructureMapServiceLocator(IContainer container)
    {
        _container = container;
    }

    public IEnumerable&amp;lt;TService&amp;gt; GetAllInstances&amp;lt;TService&amp;gt;()
    {
        return _container.GetAllInstances&amp;lt;TService&amp;gt;();
    }

    public IEnumerable&amp;lt;object&amp;gt; GetAllInstances(Type serviceType)
    {
        return (IEnumerable&amp;lt;object&amp;gt;)_container.GetAllInstances(serviceType);
    }

    public TService GetInstance&amp;lt;TService&amp;gt;(string key)
    {
        return _container.GetInstance&amp;lt;TService&amp;gt;(key);
    }

    public TService GetInstance&amp;lt;TService&amp;gt;()
    {
        return _container.GetInstance&amp;lt;TService&amp;gt;();
    }

    public object GetInstance(Type serviceType, string key)
    {
        return _container.GetInstance(serviceType, key);
    }

    public object GetInstance(Type serviceType)
    {
        return _container.GetInstance(serviceType);
    }

    public object GetService(Type serviceType)
    {
        return _container.GetInstance(serviceType);
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;User entity implements Rhino.Security.IUser interface&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our domain model we commonly have entity which represents the actual user. Rhino.Security must know which entity is the user entity in order to work. So our User entity must implement Rhino.Security.IUser interface, more precisely only SecurityInfo property from the interface must be implemented.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public class User : Rhino.Security.IUser
{
    public virtual int Id { get; protected set; }       
    public virtual string Username { get; set; }
    public virtual string PasswordHashed { get; set; }

    public Rhino.Security.SecurityInfo SecurityInfo
    {
        get
        {
            return new Rhino.Security.SecurityInfo(Username, Id);
        }
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Preparing the database schema&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Schema files can be found in the following links:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/bojanv91/RhinoSecurityWithStructureMap/blob/master/RhinoSecurityWithStructureMap/DatabaseScripts/rhino_security_and_basic_user.sql.sql"&gt;SQL dump&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Usage DEMO&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The full code sample can be found in following github repository: &lt;a href="https://github.com/bojanv91/RhinoSecurityWithStructureMap"&gt;https://github.com/bojanv91/RhinoSecurityWithStructureMap&lt;/a&gt;. Here I provide excerpt code snippets from the actual test code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Setting up user groups, operations and permissions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;var _authorizationRepository = ServiceLocator.Current.GetInstance&amp;lt;IAuthorizationRepository&amp;gt;();
var _authorizationService = ServiceLocator.Current.GetInstance&amp;lt;IAuthorizationService&amp;gt;();
var _permissionsBuilderService = ServiceLocator.Current.GetInstance&amp;lt;IPermissionsBuilderService&amp;gt;();
var _permissionService = ServiceLocator.Current.GetInstance&amp;lt;IPermissionsService&amp;gt;();

using (var transaction = _session.BeginTransaction())
{
    //creating user group 'Admin'
    _authorizationRepository.CreateUsersGroup("Admin");

    //creating operations
    _authorizationRepository.CreateOperation("/Content");
    _authorizationRepository.CreateOperation("/Content/Create");
    _authorizationRepository.CreateOperation("/Content/View");
    _authorizationRepository.CreateOperation("/Content/Delete");

    transaction.Commit();
}

using (var transaction = _session.BeginTransaction())
{
    //adding the LoggedInUser to the 'Admin' users group
    _authorizationRepository.AssociateUserWith(_loggedInUser, "Admin");

    //Building 'Allow' permissions for the LoggedInUser, 
    //by default if not defined as allowed, the operation is denied
    //For the sake of this example, we say the the users that are in 'Admin' users group can
    //create and view content, but cannot delete content. 
    _permissionsBuilderService.Allow("/Content/Create").For("Admin").OnEverything().DefaultLevel().Save();
    _permissionsBuilderService.Allow("/Content/View").For("Admin").OnEverything().DefaultLevel().Save();

    //We can explicitly define 'Deny' permission, but as the default behaviour denies everything 
    //that is not defined as 'Allow', I am not going to define it. You don't trust me? 
    //That's why we have tests ;) 
    //_permissionsBuilderService.Deny("/Content/Delete").For("Admin").OnEverything().DefaultLevel().Save();

    transaction.Commit();
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Test code demonstrating the usage:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public class RhinoTests : IUseFixture&amp;lt;TestFixture&amp;gt;
{
    private readonly IAuthorizationService _authorizationService;
    private readonly User _loggedInUser;

    public RhinoTests() 
    {
        _authorizationService = ServiceLocator.Current.GetInstance&amp;lt;IAuthorizationService&amp;gt;();
        _loggedInUser = TestFixture._loggedInUser;
    }

    [Fact]
    public void it_should_allow_content_creation()
    {
        bool result = _authorizationService.IsAllowed(_loggedInUser, "/Content/Create");
        Assert.True(result);
    }

    [Fact]
    public void it_should_allow_content_viewing()
    {
        bool result = _authorizationService.IsAllowed(_loggedInUser, "/Content/View");
        Assert.True(result);
    }

    [Fact]
    public void it_should_deny_content_deletition()
    {
        bool result = _authorizationService.IsAllowed(_loggedInUser, "/Content/Delete");
        Assert.False(result);
    }

    public void SetFixture(TestFixture data) { }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Goals&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Auditing schema changes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Auditing test data changes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keeping schema and test data integrity across machines&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Versioning via source version control systems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DB-provider agnostic migration (MSSQL, PostgreSql, MySql, Oracle)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Simple and automated migration strategy (local and in production)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New developers on project should not sweat while making the database work on their machines, neither the CI server   &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Links to &lt;a href="https://github.com/schambers/fluentmigrator/wiki"&gt;Fluent Migrator&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://github.com/bojanv91/DatabaseMigrationsExample"&gt;this guide's project&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end - all you just need to do is run MSBuildMigrator.Migrate.bat file and watch your database being deployed, upgraded, downgraded...it will figure out ;) .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Step by step guide&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;1. Open Visual Studio and create New Class Library Project&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://bojanv91.github.io/images/2014-12-12-database-development-guidance/img01.png" alt="Open Visual Studio and create New Class Library Project" /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;2. Install-Package FluentMigrator&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://bojanv91.github.io/images/2014-12-12-database-development-guidance/img02.png" alt="Install-Package FluentMigrator" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;3. Create new folder "Migrations" to project - here we are going to store migration files&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://bojanv91.github.io/images/2014-12-12-database-development-guidance/img03.png" alt="Create new folder &amp;quot;Migrations&amp;quot; to project - here we are going to store migration files" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;4. Now, let's create database tables with migration files&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[FluentMigrator.Migration(0)]
public class Baseline : FluentMigrator.Migration
{
    public override void Up()
    {
        Create.Table("Category")
            .WithColumn("Id").AsGuid().NotNullable().PrimaryKey()
            .WithColumn("Name").AsString(255);

        Create.Table("Product")
            .WithColumn("Id").AsGuid().NotNullable().PrimaryKey()
            .WithColumn("CategoryId").AsGuid().ForeignKey("Category", "Id")
            .WithColumn("Name").AsString(255)
            .WithColumn("Price").AsDecimal();
    }

    public override void Down()
    {
        Delete.Table("Product");
        Delete.Table("Category");
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is all what is needed. In essence a migration is a class which drives from &lt;strong&gt;Migration abstract class&lt;/strong&gt;  and implements &lt;strong&gt;'Up'&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;'Down'&lt;/strong&gt; methods. Additionally you will also need to define &lt;strong&gt;Migration Attribute&lt;/strong&gt; with unique identifier in order the migration runner to know the order of migration files. I like it how FM API is designed, it really follows the SQL language and how I would write this script in plain SQL.
Read further &lt;a href="https://github.com/schambers/fluentmigrator/wiki/Migration"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just for providing more examples I have added one more migration file for adding one more column to Product table for storing image URL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[Migration(201411131100)]
public class M201411131100_Product_added_column_for_storing_image_url : Migration
{
    public override void Up()
    {
        Alter.Table("Product")
            .AddColumn("ImageUrl").AsString(255);
    }

    public override void Down()
    {
        Delete.Column("ImageUrl").FromTable("Product");
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now this is how everything looks in my solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://bojanv91.github.io/images/2014-12-12-database-development-guidance/img04.png" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, let's initialize the database with our script. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;5. Creating Migration Runner (MSBuild), Migrator (.BAT) and ConnectionStrings (.CONFIG)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://bojanv91.github.io/images/2014-12-12-database-development-guidance/img05.png" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;1. MSBuildMigrationRunner.proj&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;    &amp;lt;?xml version="1.0"?&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;Project xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/developer/msbuild/2003" DefaultTargets="Migrate"&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;PropertyGroup&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;DatabaseProvider&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/DatabaseProvider&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;ConnectionStringConfigPath&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ConnectionStringConfigPath&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;ConnectionStringName&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ConnectionStringName&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;DataMigrationProjectName&amp;gt;DatabaseMigrationsExample&amp;lt;/DataMigrationProjectName&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;DataMigrationProjectRootPath&amp;gt;$(MSBuildProjectDirectory)&amp;lt;/DataMigrationProjectRootPath&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;MigratorTasksDirectory&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/MigratorTasksDirectory&amp;gt;

            &amp;lt;DataMigrationProjectBuildDLL&amp;gt;$(DataMigrationProjectRootPath)\bin\Debug\$(DataMigrationProjectName).dll&amp;lt;/DataMigrationProjectBuildDLL&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;DataMigrationProjectCsproj&amp;gt;$(DataMigrationProjectRootPath)\$(DataMigrationProjectName).csproj&amp;lt;/DataMigrationProjectCsproj&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;/PropertyGroup&amp;gt;

        &amp;lt;UsingTask TaskName="FluentMigrator.MSBuild.Migrate" AssemblyFile="$(MigratorTasksDirectory)FluentMigrator.MSBuild.dll"/&amp;gt;

        &amp;lt;Target Name="Build"&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;MSBuild Projects="$(DataMigrationProjectCsproj)" Properties="Configuration=Debug"/&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;/Target&amp;gt;

        &amp;lt;Target Name="Migrate" DependsOnTargets="Build"&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;Message Text="Starting FluentMigrator Migration"/&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;Migrate Database="$(DatabaseProvider)"
                     Connection="$(ConnectionStringName)"
                     ConnectionStringConfigPath="$(ConnectionStringConfigPath)"
                     Target="$(DataMigrationProjectBuildDLL)"
                     Output="True"
                     Verbose="True"&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;/Migrate&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;/Target&amp;gt;

        &amp;lt;Target Name="MigratePreview" DependsOnTargets="Build"&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;Message Text="Previewing FluentMigrator Migration"/&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;Migrate Database="$(DatabaseProvider)"
                     Connection="$(ConnectionStringName)"
                     ConnectionStringConfigPath="$(ConnectionStringConfigPath)"
                     Target="$(DataMigrationProjectBuildDLL)"
                     Output="True"
                     Verbose="True"
                     PreviewOnly="True"&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;/Migrate&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;/Target&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/Project&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;2. ConnectionStrings.config&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;    &amp;lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;configuration&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;connectionStrings&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;clear /&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;add name="Default" connectionString="Server=###;User ID=###;Password=###;Database=###;"/&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;/connectionStrings&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/configuration&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;3. MSBuildMigrator.Migrate.bat&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;    C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319\MSBuild.exe MSBuildMigrationRunner.proj /t:Migrate /p:DatabaseProvider=SqlServer2012 /p:ConnectionStringConfigPath=ConnectionStrings.config /p:ConnectionStringName=Default /p:DataMigrationProjectName=DatabaseMigrationsExample /p:DataMigrationProjectRootPath=. /p:MigratorTasksDirectory=..\packages\FluentMigrator.1.3.1.0\tools\
    pause
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;/t:Migrate - performs Migration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;/t:MigratePreview - performs previewing of what would happen when migration is called&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;/p:DatabaseProvider=? - specify your database providers name (SqlServer2012, postgres, mysql, oracle, sqlite and other can be found in FluentMigrator documentation)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;/p:ConnectionStringConfigPath=? - path to connection strings file&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;/p:ConnectionStringName=? - name of the connection string to use from the configuration file&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;/p:DataMigrationProjectName=? - Visual Studio project name where your migration files reside&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;/p:DataMigrationProjectRootPath=? - path to where your Visual Studio migration project resides&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;/p:MigratorTasksDirectory=? - path to FluentMigrator tools folder &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Viola, this is all you need to do. For your project you will need to put the connection string to your database and make changes where needed in the .BAT file, such as database provider and project name as an essential changes. Other config stuff should be pretty common, but if you have different structure than mine, you have full power and control with the flexibility provided here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;5. Run your MSBuildMigrator.Migrate.bat file&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://bojanv91.github.io/images/2014-12-12-database-development-guidance/img06.png" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Table VersionInfo is used for storing migration metadata.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://bojanv91.github.io/images/2014-12-12-database-development-guidance/img07.png" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of our tables are created.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://bojanv91.github.io/images/2014-12-12-database-development-guidance/img08.png" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In VersionInfo table you can see the "commits".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://bojanv91.github.io/images/2014-12-12-database-development-guidance/img09.png" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Rules of Thumb&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First migration is always called "BaseLine" with migration ID: 0. Everything starts from there.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Migration unique identification number is composed of current datetime when the migration is being created in format #yyyyMMddhhmm#&lt;br /&gt;
(example: now is 2014-11-13 10:15, so migration ID would be 201411131015)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Migration filename should explain what is being changed - just like how you would write a commit message - in format 'M#yyyyMMddhhmm#_Message.cs'&lt;br /&gt;
(example: M201411131015_created_all_initial_tables)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Class name should follow the exact convention like the filename&lt;br /&gt;
(example: class M201411131015_created_all_initial_tables { .. }&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MSBuildMigrationRunner.proj, ConnectionStrings.config, MSBuildMigrator.Migrate.bat are stored in Migration project root folder&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
